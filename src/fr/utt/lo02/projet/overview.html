<h1>Shape Up Game</h1>
<p>This project is a MVC GUI application representing the board game Shape Up.
    The project is designed in 3 different main packages:</p>
<br>

<ul>
    <li>model: game API that are called by the controller, notifies his state change to the view</li>
<li>view: handle user input and call controller method
</li>
    <li>controller: transform view call (user) in game one (on the model)
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>
The application can be consequently seen as a graph or a state machine.
A user make an action, the view call the controller method, which translate it into correct
model method call. The controller also changes the state of the model. The latter notifies the view,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
The view is divided into a package for the console and another one for the hmi view.
The model is divided into 4 different package, one for the board, another for the game,
and two more for the player and his strategy.
There is also a junit package used to test the core of the game.
<br>
The game is playable with 2 views (a console and hmi one) at the same time and therefore supports
multithreading.
